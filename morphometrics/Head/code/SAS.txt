*RW1-9 account for 98.98% of variation,drops all those rw's that account for less than 1% of variation individually;

# Proc print: Not included, but can be used to visualize any mistakes

# Multivariate Linear Mixed Analysis

## Prepare Data

# Prepares data for multivariate linear mixed analysis. Analogous to a repeated measures design 
* the following procedure is required to get the data in the correct format to use the repeated measures approach;
PROC TRANSPOSE DATA=ALL OUT=ALLT NAME=OLDRW PREFIX=RW;
BY ID sp week;
# ‘By’ variables occur on every single line
VAR RW1-RW9;
RUN;

# Sort all transposed data
PROC SORT DATA=ALLT;
BY ID sp week;
RUN;
ods graphics on;

## Mixed Model

# Method = maximum likelihood
# covtest = covariance test
# Plots of residual panel allows us to see if they meet assumptions of multivariate linear model
PROC MIXED DATA=ALLT method=ml covtest plots=residualpanel;
CLASS ID sp week oldrw;
# Include random effects and fixed effects
# ID = random effect (repeated effect)
# Oldrw = index variable
MODEL RW1 = sp week oldrw sp*oldrw week*oldrw sp*week*oldrw/DDFM=KENWARDROGER SOLUTION;
*RANDOM LOC;
# Index variable allows us to match up relative warps. Mean of all relative warps = 0
# Interaction = analogous to treatment by time interaction in repeated measures. If we want to know if CS is a significant predictor in shape on at least some RW’s then use cs*oldrw
# Degrees of freedom method = KenwardRoger – algorithm that calculates degrees of freedom
# Can say Random ID (see above), but can lead to inestimable response.
# Specifies a structure. Specifies that ID is a random effect. This line is the mixed part of the model
# TYPE = VC (variance components). If use default (TYPE = unk), SAS will get clogged up and gives up an inestimable response. For PC’s type = VC seems to be a reasonable estimate. Gives it a starting point.
